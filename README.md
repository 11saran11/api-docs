# Getting Started

## How does it work?

The Nexudus Spaces API is implemented as JSON or XML over HTTP using all four verbs \(GET/POST/PUT/DELETE\). Each resource, like Coworker, Checkin or Booking has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, weâ€™ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.

This means that your application must be available on the Internet for users to install it. It can be hosted in any type of server and programmed in any language, as long as it can perform basic HTTP requests.

## General Structure

The API is divided in 7 main areas. You can get details about the resources in each of them by using the menu on the left.

* Billing: data related to charges from us to your account or from other apps.
* Community: data related to the community boards.
* Content: data related to the blog and newsletters.
* MRM: stands for Member Relationship Management and it relates to functions and data regarding members and the information you store about them.
* Spaces: data related to a space, like members profiles, bookings or resources.
* Support: data related to the support feactures, like chats and help messages.
* System: data related to Nexudus Spaces core services.
